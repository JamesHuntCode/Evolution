# EvolutionarySteeringBehaviours
A project I saw recently really got me interested. The aim of this project is to make "agents" or "nodes" that need to eat the food to survive and avoid the poison. Those that are well suited can pass on their DNA to their offspring. In a way, this project will demonstrate evolution and natural selection.
